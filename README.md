# `workflow.nvim`
Neovim plugin to manage text files, from creation to potential export.

## Concept
- create new files with dynamically generated templates
- import code snippets (i.e. k8s snippets)
- export in static or dynamic PDF using Pandoc

### UX
The idea would be to have a similar experience than with `lazygit`:

- floating window as main TUI
- simple menus to choose whatever action to do next
- possibility to add/edit/delete new templates/snippets from here
- other possibility to manage all this: config directory with files
